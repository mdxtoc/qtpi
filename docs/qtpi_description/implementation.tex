\section{The symbolic calculator}
\seclabel{symboliccalculator}

Qtpi has a symbolic calculator, which performs matrix and vector arithmetic with symbolic numerals representing complex numbers. A symbolic numeral is a sum of real part $x$ and imaginary part $y$, each a symbolic real, representing $x+iy$.

A symbolic real is a sum of symbolic real products. 

A symbolic real product is a rational (a fraction with unbounded integer numerator and denominator) and a sequence of elements. The elements are 
\begin{itemize*}
\item square roots of rationals;
\item trigonometric functions $\sin{}$ and $\cos{}$ with rational arguments;
\item the constant $\pi$;
\item real and imaginary parts of variables $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$.
\end{itemize*}

The rationals are provided by OCaml's Q package, itself an interface to the GNU multi-precision arithmetic library libgmp. The whole-number numerator and denominator in a rational are of unbounded length -- constrained, of course, by the physical quantities of memory of the computer running the library.  In practice, a usefully very very very large range.

Real and imaginary parts of a variable are shown, as infrequently as possible, as $a_{i}\mathbb{r}$ and $a_{i}\mathbb{i}$.

Arguments of trigonometric functions are reduced in construction to the interval $(0,45]$ (which doesn't include 0, but does include 45) by using the identities
\begin{itemize*}
\item $\cos\theta->\cos{(\theta\mod360)}$, $\sin\theta->\sin{(\theta\mod360)}$;
\item if $\theta>180$ then $\cos\theta-> \cos{(360-\theta)}$, $\sin\theta-> -\sin{(360-\theta)}$
\item if $\theta>90$ then $\cos\theta-> -\cos{(180-\theta)}$, $\sin\theta-> \sin{(180-\theta)}$
\item $\cos0->1$, $\sin90->1$, $\cos{90}->0$, $\sin0->0$
\item $\cos60->\frac{1}{2}$, $sin30->\frac{1}{2}$
\item if $\theta>45$ then $\cos\theta->\sin{(90-\theta)}$, $\sin\theta->\cos{(90-\theta)}$
\item $\sin45->\cos45$
\end{itemize*}


\subsection{Simplification}

Sums are simplified in two ways:
\begin{itemize*}
\item $n*P+m*P=(n+m)*P$ -- sum the rationals if the element sequences are the same
\item $|a_{i}|^{2}+|b^{i}|^{2}$ -- if there are elements $n*P*a_{i}\mathbb{r}$, $n*P*a_{i}\mathbb{i}$, $n*P*b_{i}\mathbb{r}$, $n*P*b_{i}\mathbb{i}$, replace by $n*P$.
\end{itemize*}

Products are simplified by
\begin{itemize*}
\item $\sqrt{x}\times\sqrt{x}=x$
\item trigonometric identities
\end{itemize*}
 
$\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$ is represented by $\cos{45}$; $\frac{1}{\sqrt3}$ by $\frac{2}{3}\cos{30}$.

Square roots are not simplified until measurement, except that $\sqrt{x}\times\sqrt{x}$ is replaced by $x$. 



The measurement mechanism calculates a probability from symbolic amplitudes, and to do so must sometimes approximate. That calculation also has access to the secret values of variables.
