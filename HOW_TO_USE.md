# Get Me

from [GitHub](https://github.com/mdxtoc/qtpi): use the "Clone or download" button. No tar bundles yet.

# Build Me

  On a terminal/console

        make clean
        make links
        make Qtpi

  You will need OCaml (currently I'm building with version 4.06.0). On Windows you may need cygwin: I lose track of their build systems.
  
# Try Me

        ,/Qtpi examples/??.qtp
        
  Lots of examples to try.
  
# RTFM

  See the 'docs' directory. Not v much to read, and not always quite up to date (sorry).
